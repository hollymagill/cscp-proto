          Pupils included in the 2021/22 school and college performance measures

          We, therefore, recommend not making direct comparisons between
          schools/colleges or MATs, or with data from previous years.
          Comparisons with local and national averages can be made cautiously to
          put an individual school/college or MAT’s results into context.

            Several changes were made to exams and grading. These include
            advanced notice of exam topics and GCSE, AS and A level grading
            being based around a midpoint between 2021 and pre-pandemic
            outcomes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Changes were also made to the way school and college performance
            measures were calculated. Results achieved between January 2020 and
            August 2021 by pupils included in this year’s measures are not

                compared to pupils across England who got similar results at the

                <a href="">English Baccalaureate</a> qualifications including

                From 2021/22 Progress 8 scores are calculated using KS2 outcomes

                See the secondary accountability measures guidance for more

              <p class="govuk-body">
                In a small number of cases, pupils can have extremely negative
                progress scores that disproportionately affect a school’s
                overall progress score. To reduce the impact of these extreme
                scores, we set a limit on how negative a pupil’s progress score
                can be when calculating the school average. This will normally
                apply to 1 or 2 pupils per school, if any. Where a pupil’s score
                is more negative than this minimum value, an adjusted score will
                replace the pupil’s original progress score for the purpose of
                calculating a school’s overall progress average.

                Schools and colleges not covering full Progress 8 period
              </h3>
              <p class="govuk-body">
                Some schools start educating pupils partway through the 5-year
                period covered by Progress 8, which should be taken into account
                when comparing their results with schools that start at Key
                Stage 3. Progress 8 is not the most appropriate performance
                measure for university technical colleges, studio schools and
                some further education colleges. These establishments typically
                start educating pupils at age 14, with a focus on preparing
                pupils for their future careers by providing an integrated
                academic and professional education. Other headline measures,
                particularly pupil destinations, are more important for these
                establishments.
              </p>
              <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">What are confidence intervals?</h3>
              <p class="govuk-body">
                It is difficult to say with certainty how much of the progress
                scores are down to the school (which may have scored higher with
                a different group of pupils) and how much is down to the pupils
                (for example some may have performed well at any school). The
                confidence intervals reflect this uncertainty. If the confidence
                intervals for 2 schools overlap, then we can't say for certain
                that the 2 progress scores for these schools are significantly
                different.
              </p>
              <p class="govuk-body">
                Generally speaking, the greater the number of pupils, the
                smaller the range of the confidence interval. For smaller
                schools, the confidence interval tends to be larger, since fewer
                pupils are included, and therefore the score will be more
                greatly impacted by performance of individual pupils.
              </p>
              <p class="govuk-body">
                A school is above average if its Progress 8 score is above 0 and
                the whole confidence interval is above 0. Similarly, a school is
                below average if its Progress 8 score is below 0 and the whole
                confidence interval is below 0.

                The EBacc APS calculates a pupil's average point scores across
                the 5 pillars of the English Baccalaureate, allocating points to
                a pupil's best grades and dividing by 6 (the science grades
                count in 2 pillars, meaning a total of 6 pillars) to create an
                average point score per pupil. This measure is an average across
                the subjects (i.e. we divide the total by 6) and so is on a
                different scale to Attainment 8 which we calculated by simply
                awarding points score across 8 qualifications (without dividing
                the total).
              </p>
              <p class="govuk-body">
                This measure is based on the better result of either English
                language or English literature when both subjects are taken,
                maths, the best 2 results from the single sciences (3 out of 4
                must be taken), or results from the combined science, the better
                result from either geography or history and the best result in
                languages.

            destination measures). We avoid making these figures public to
