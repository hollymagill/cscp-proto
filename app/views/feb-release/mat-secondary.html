          Pupils included in the 2021/22 school and college performance measures
          will have had an <strong>uneven disruption to their learning.</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          We, therefore, recommend not making direct comparisons between
          schools, or with data from previous years. Comparisons with local and
          national averages can be made cautiously to put an individual school
          or college’s results into context.
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          There are other factors that will also make direct comparisons

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>
            Several changes were made to exams and grading. These include
            advanced notice of exam topics and GCSE, AS and A level grading
            being based around a midpoint between 2021 and pre-pandemic
            outcomes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Changes were also made to the way school and college performance
            measures were calculated. Results achieved between January 2020 and
            August 2021 by pupils included in this year’s measures are not
            included in the calculations.

                This score shows how much progress pupils at this MAT
                (multi-academy trust) made between the end of key stage 2 and
                the end of key stage 4, compared to pupils across England who
                got similar results at the end of key stage 2. This is based on
                results in up to 8 qualifications, which include English, maths,
                3 English Baccalaureate qualifications including sciences,
                computer science, history, geography and languages, and 3 other
                additional approved qualifications.

              <p class="govuk-body">
                The progress score for each MAT is calculated from the progress
                scores of its schools, weighted by length of time the school has
                been with the MAT and the number of pupils who were in year 11
                in the school.
              </p>
              <p class="govuk-body">
                A score above zero means pupils made more progress, on average,
                than pupils across England who got similar results at the end of
                key stage 2.
              </p>
              <p class="govuk-body">
                A score below zero means pupils made less progress, on average,
                than pupils across England who got similar results at the end of
                key stage 2.
              </p>
              <p class="govuk-body">
                A negative progress score does not mean pupils made no progress,
                or the MAT has failed, rather it means pupils in the MAT made
                less progress than other pupils across England with similar
                results at the end of key stage 2.
              </p>
              <p class="govuk-body">
                In a small number of cases, pupils can have extremely negative
                progress scores that disproportionately affect a MAT's overall
                progress score. To reduce the impact of these extreme scores, we
                set a limit on how negative a pupil's progress score can be when
                calculating the MAT average. This will normally apply to 1 or 2
                pupils per school, if any. Where a pupil's score is more
                negative than this minimum value, an adjusted score will replace
                the pupil's original progress score for the purpose of
                calculating a MAT’s overall progress average.
              </p>
              <p class="govuk-body">
                Progress 8 cannot be compared directly year on year. For
                example, knowing a MAT had a Progress 8 score of -0.2 in 2019
                and a score of -0.2 in 2022 tells you how the MAT compared to
                the national average in those years but not whether its
                performance improved across years. When considering the 2022
                data, it is also important to take account of the uneven impact
                of the pandemic, and other factors such as changes to grading
                and methodology for calculating KS4 performance measures. See

                Progress 8. This should be taken into account when comparing
                their results with those for schools which start educating their

                      progress scores are down to the school (which may have
                      scored higher with a different group of pupils) and how
                      much is down to the pupils (for example some may have
                      performed well at any school). The confidence intervals
                      reflect this uncertainty. If the confidence intervals for
                      2 schools overlap, then we can't say for certain that the

                      Generally speaking, the greater the number of pupils, the

                      of 6 pillars) to create an average point score per pupil.
                      This measure is an average across the subjects (i.e. we
                      divide the total by 6) and so is on a different scale to

                      <strong>Converter academy</strong> - A school which has
                      chosen to convert to academy status. It inherits the
                      performance history of its predecessor school, unlike a
                      sponsor led academy, which does not.

                      <strong>Sponsored academy</strong> - These academies
                      differ from other academies in that they are established
                      by a sponsor. Also, although any academy can have a
                      sponsor, those which are 'sponsor led' were deemed by the
                      Department for Education to be underperforming and in need
                      of help from a sponsor to improve performance. Sponsor led
                      means that a sponsor such as a charity or a business has
                      been appointed to help improve the school's performance.
                      The sponsor also sets up a trust to run the academy. While
                      academy converters inherit the performance history of the
                      predecessor school, sponsor led academies do not.

                      can be established by a charity, a community group,
                      parents or a business. They have more control over how
                      they do things, for example whether to follow the national
                      curriculum, setting staff pay and conditions and the
                      length of school terms and the school day. Like other
                      state schools, there are no fees for parents to pay,
                      'free' is intended in the sense of 'free to make their own

                      <strong>University technical colleges (UTCs)</strong> -
                      These are a type of academy for 14- to 19-year-olds, and
                      provide an education that meets the needs of employers.
                      They offer technical courses and work-related learning,
                      combined with academic studies. UTCs have between 500 and
                      800 students and are sponsored by a local university and
                      employers. It is also usual for further education colleges
                      and other educational institutions – like established
                      academy trusts – to work in partnership with them. Support
                      is in the form of these organisations sharing their
                      expertise with the college and helping to develop the
                      curriculum.

                      <strong>Studio school</strong> - Studio schools are small
                      schools (usually with around 300 pupils) for 14- to
                      19-year-olds of all abilities (a small number are 13-19).
                      Students work with local employers and a personal coach,
                      and follow a curriculum designed to give them the skills
                      and qualifications they need in work, or to take up
                      further education. Studio schools offer academic and
                      vocational qualifications and teach them in a practical
                      and project-based way. They combine study and work
                      placements with local and national employers. They are set
                      up with the backing of local businesses and employers.
                      Studio schools give students a strong base in English,
                      maths and science. They also encourage students to develop
                      skills like punctuality, good communication, reliability
                      and team working.

                  MATs are included in these measures if they have at least 3
                  schools covering this phase of education that have been with
                  the MAT for at least 3 academic years and for which we have
                  published performance data.

                  Special schools, pupil refÛerral units, alternative provision

                  In the 2022 results, schools are counted under the MAT they
                  were part of as of 14 September 2021, as long as they had been
                  with the MAT since before 14 September 2019. To view all
                  schools currently under the MAT / sponsor visit the Acme

                  Where an academy sponsor oversees a more than a single
                  multi-academy trust, results are presented under the name of
                  the sponsor rather than the individual MATs.
