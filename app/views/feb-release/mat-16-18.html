          Uneven impact of the pandemic on 2021/22 school, college and
          multi-academy trust performance data
        </h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          Pupils included in the 2021/22 school, college and multi-academy trust
          (MAT) performance measures will have had
          <strong>uneven disruption to their learning</strong>.
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          We, therefore, recommend not making direct comparisons between
          schools/colleges or MATs, or with data from previous years.
          Comparisons with local and national averages can be made cautiously to
          put an individual school/college or MAT’s results into context.
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          There are other factors that will also make direct comparisons
          difficult:
        </p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>
            Several changes were made to exams and grading. These include
            advanced notice of exam topics and GCSE, AS and A level grading
            being based around a midpoint between 2021 and pre-pandemic
            outcomes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Changes were also made to the way school and college (and therefore
            also Multi Academy Trust) performance measures were calculated.
            Results achieved between January 2020 and August 2021 by pupils
            included in this year’s measures are not included in the
            calculations.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          For a full explanation of all the factors affecting these results
          please see the KS4 and 16-18 2021/22 technical guides.
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          The individual school, college and MAT data should be used with
          caution. It reflects a school/college or MAT’s results in 2021/22 but
          cannot provide information about the factors which may have influenced
          these results.
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          When forming a view of how well the school/college or MAT is doing,
          you should consider a range of different information sources, for
          example, discussing with the school or college directly, using school
          or college websites, reading Ofsted reports, and seeking views of
          friends, and family.

                      they were part of as of 14 September 2021, as long as they

                      <strong>Converter academy</strong> - A school which has
                      chosen to convert to academy status. It inherits the
                      performance history of its predecessor school, unlike a
                      sponsor led academy, which does not.

                    <p class="govuk-body">
                      <strong>Sponsored academy</strong> - These academies
                      differ from other academies in that they are established
                      by a sponsor. Also, although any academy can have a
                      sponsor, those which are 'sponsor led' were deemed by the
                      Department for Education to be underperforming and in need
                      of help from a sponsor to improve performance. Sponsor led
                      means that a sponsor such as a charity or a business has
                      been appointed to help improve the school's performance.
                      The sponsor also sets up a trust to run the academy. While
                      academy converters inherit the performance history of the
                      predecessor school, sponsor led academies do not.

                      by the government and not run by a local authority. They
                      can be established by a charity, a community group,
                      parents or a business. They have more control over how
                      they do things, for example whether to follow the national
                      curriculum, setting staff pay and conditions and the
                      length of school terms and the school day. Like other
                      state schools, there are no fees for parents to pay,
                      'free' is intended in the sense of 'free to make their own
                      decisions'.

                      <strong>University technical colleges (UTCs)</strong> -
                      These are a type of academy for 14- to 19-year-olds, and
                      provide an education that meets the needs of employers.
                      They offer technical courses and work-related learning,
                      combined with academic studies. UTCs have between 500 and
                      800 students and are sponsored by a local university and
                      employers. It is also usual for further education colleges
                      and other educational institutions – like established
                      academy trusts – to work in partnership with them. Support
                      is in the form of these organisations sharing their
                      expertise with the college and helping to develop the
                      curriculum.

                    <p class="govuk-body">
                      <strong>Studio school</strong> - Studio schools are small
                      schools (usually with around 300 students) for 14- to
                      19-year-olds of all abilities (a small number are 13-19).
                      Students work with local employers and a personal coach,
                      and follow a curriculum designed to give them the skills
                      and qualifications they need in work, or to take up
                      further education. Studio schools offer academic and
                      vocational qualifications and teach them in a practical
                      and project-based way. They combine study and work
                      placements with local and national employers. They are set
                      up with the backing of local businesses and employers.
                      Studio schools give students a strong base in English,
                      maths and science. They also encourage students to develop
                      skills like punctuality, good communication, reliability
                      and team working.

                      Department for Education to be underperforming and in need
                      of help from a sponsor to improve performance. Sponsor led
                      means that a sponsor such as a charity or a business has
                      been appointed to help improve the school's performance.
                      The sponsor also sets up a trust to run the academy. While
                      academy converters inherit the performance history of the
                      predecessor school, sponsor led academies do not.

                      employers. It is also usual for further education colleges
                      and other educational institutions – like established
                      academy trusts – to work in partnership with them. Support
                      is in the form of these organisations sharing their
                      expertise with the college and helping to develop the
                      curriculum.

                      <strong>Studio school</strong> - Studio schools are small
                      schools (usually with around 300 students) for 14- to
                      19-year-olds of all abilities (a small number are 13-19).
                      Students work with local employers and a personal coach,
                      and follow a curriculum designed to give them the skills
                      and qualifications they need in work, or to take up
                      further education. Studio schools offer academic and
                      vocational qualifications and teach them in a practical
                      and project-based way. They combine study and work
                      placements with local and national employers. They are set
                      up with the backing of local businesses and employers.
                      Studio schools give students a strong base in English,
                      maths and science. They also encourage students to develop
                      skills like punctuality, good communication, reliability
                      and team working.
