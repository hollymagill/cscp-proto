                      and the end of key stage 4, compared to pupils across
                      England who got similar results at the end of key stage 2.
                      This is based on results in up to 8 qualifications, which
                      include English, maths, 3 English Baccalaureate

                      The progress score for each MAT is calculated from the
                      progress scores of its schools, weighted by length of time
                      the school has been with the MAT and the number of pupils
                      who were in year 11 in the school.

                    <p class="govuk-body">
                      A score above zero means pupils made more progress, on

                      results at the end of key stage 2.

                      results at the end of key stage 2.

                      A negative progress score does not mean pupils made no
                      progress, or the school has failed, rather it means pupils
                      in the school made less progress than other pupils across
                      England with similar results at the end of key stage 2.

                    <p class="govuk-body">
                      In a small number of cases, pupils can have extremely
                      negative progress scores that disproportionately affect a
                      MAT's overall progress score. To reduce the impact of
                      these extreme scores, we set a limit on how negative a
                      pupil's progress score can be when calculating the MAT
                      average. This will normally apply to 1 or 2 pupils per
                      school, if any. Where a pupil's score is more negative
                      than this minimum value, an adjusted score will replace
                      the pupil's original progress score for the purpose of
                      calculating a MAT’s overall progress average.

                    <p class="govuk-body">
                      Progress 8 cannot be compared directly year on year. For
                      example, knowing a MAT had a Progress 8 score of -0.2 in
                      2019 and a score of -0.2 in 2022 tells you how the MAT
                      compared to the national average in those years but not
                      whether its performance improved across years. When
                      considering the 2022 data, it is also important to take
                      account of the uneven impact of the pandemic, and other
                      factors such as changes to grading and methodology for
                      calculating KS4 performance measures.

                      What are confidence intervals?
                    </h3>

                    <p class="govuk-body">
                      It is difficult to say with certainty how much of the
                      progress scores are down to the school (which may have
                      scored higher with a different group of pupils) and how
                      much is down to the pupils (for example some may have
                      performed well at any school). The confidence intervals
                      reflect this uncertainty. If the confidence intervals for
                      2 schools overlap, then we can't say for certain that the
                      2 progress scores for these schools are significantly
                      different.
                    </p>
                    <p class="govuk-body">
                      Generally speaking, the greater the number of pupils, the
                      smaller the range of the confidence interval. For smaller
                      schools, the confidence interval tends to be larger, since
                      fewer pupils are included, and therefore the score will be
                      more greatly impacted by performance of individual pupils.

                    <p class="govuk-body">
                      A school is above average if its Progress 8 score is above
                      0 and the whole confidence interval is above 0. Similarly,
                      a school is below average if its Progress 8 score is below
                      0 and the whole confidence interval is below 0.

                      The EBacc APS calculates a pupil's average point scores
                      across the 5 pillars of the English Baccalaureate,
                      allocating points to a pupil's best grades and dividing by
                      6 (the science grades count in 2 pillars, meaning a total
                      of 6 pillars) to create an average point score per pupil.
                      This measure is an average across the subjects (i.e. we
                      divide the total by 6) and so is on a different scale to
                      Attainment 8 which we calculated by simply awarding points
                      score across 8 qualifications (without dividing the
                      total).

                    <p class="govuk-body">
                      This measure is based on the better result of either
                      English language or English literature when both subjects
                      are taken, maths, the best 2 results from the single
                      sciences (3 out of 4 must be taken), or results from the
                      combined science, the better result from either geography
                      or history and the best result in languages.

                        <strong>Sponsored academy</strong> - These academies
                        differ from other academies in that they are established
                        by a sponsor. Also, although any academy can have a
                        sponsor, those which are 'sponsor led' were deemed by
                        the Department for Education to be underperforming and
                        in need of help from a sponsor to improve performance.
                        Sponsor led means that a sponsor such as a charity or a
                        business has been appointed to help improve the school's
                        performance. The sponsor also sets up a trust to run the
                        academy. While academy converters inherit the
                        performance history of the predecessor school, sponsor
                        led academies do not.

                        provide an education that meets the needs of employers.
                        They offer technical courses and work-related learning,
                        combined with academic studies. UTCs have between 500
                        and 800 students and are sponsored by a local university
                        and employers. It is also usual for further education
                        colleges and other educational institutions – like
                        established academy trusts – to work in partnership with
                        them. Support is in the form of these organisations

                        develop the curriculum.

                        to 19-year-olds of all abilities (a small number are
                        13-19). Students work with local employers and a
                        personal coach, and follow a curriculum designed to give
                        them the skills and qualifications they need in work, or
                        to take up further education. Studio schools offer
                        academic and vocational qualifications and teach them in
                        a practical and project-based way. They combine study
                        and work placements with local and national employers.
                        They are set up with the backing of local businesses and
                        employers. Studio schools give students a strong base in
                        English, maths and science. They also encourage students
                        to develop skills like punctuality, good communication,
                        reliability and team working.

                            to improve performance. Sponsor led means that a
                            sponsor such as a charity or a business has been
                            appointed to help improve the school's performance.
                            The sponsor also sets up a trust to run the academy.

                            history of the predecessor school, sponsor led

                            competitive application process. Free school

                            sciences), alongside core academic subjects. Pupils
                            integrate academic study and practical learning
                            within a technical and professional curriculum,
                            which builds employability skills and professional
                            behaviours.

                            <strong>Studio school</strong> - These are a type of
                            free school offering a distinctive, employer focused
                            educational experience. Their core purpose is to
                            improve students’ employability and life skills.
                            Studio schools are small schools (usually with
                            around 300 pupils), predominantly for
                            14-19-year-olds of all abilities. They offer a range
                            of academic and vocational qualifications, often
                            taught through project-based learning, alongside
                            work experience. Students work with local employers
                            and follow a curriculum designed to give them the
                            skills and qualifications they need in work, or to
                            take up further education.

                  Applied general are qualifications that provide broad study of
                  a vocational area. They are designed to lead to higher
                  education and they include areas such as performing arts,
                  business and health and social care. See
                  <a href="">technical and vocational qualifications</a> for
                  more details. These figures are based on students who were
                  entered for at least one applied general qualification. For

                            give a points value to all qualifications so you can

                            were deemed by the Department for Education to be
                            underperforming and in need of help from a sponsor
                            to improve performance. Sponsor led means that a
                            sponsor such as a charity or a business has been
                            appointed to help improve the school's performance.
                            The sponsor also sets up a trust to run the academy.
                            While academy converters inherit the performance
                            history of the predecessor school, sponsor led
                            academies do not.

                            for parents to pay, ‘free’ is intended in the sense
