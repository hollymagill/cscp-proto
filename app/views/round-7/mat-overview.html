          Uneven impact of the pandemic on 2021/22 school and college
          performance data
        </h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          Pupils included in the 2021/22 school and college performance measures
          will have had an <strong>uneven disruption to their learning.</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          We, therefore, recommend not making direct comparisons between
          schools, or with data from previous years. Comparisons with local and
          national averages can be made cautiously to put an individual school
          or college’s results into context.
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          There are other factors that will also make direct comparisons
          difficult:
        </p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>
            Several changes were made to exams and grading. These include
            advanced notice of exam topics and GCSE, AS and A level grading
            being based around a midpoint between 2021 and pre-pandemic
            outcomes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Changes were also made to the way school and college performance
            measures were calculated. Results achieved between January 2020 and
            August 2021 by pupils included in this year’s measures are not
            included in the calculations.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          For a full explanation of all the factors affecting these results
          please see the KS4 and 16-18 2021/22 technical guides.
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          The individual school and college data should be used with caution. It
          reflects a school or college’s results in 2021/22 but cannot provide
          information about the factors which may have influenced these results.
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          When forming a view of how well the school or college is doing, you
          should consider a range of different information sources, for example,
          discussing with the school or college directly, the school or college
          website, Ofsted reports, friends, and family.
